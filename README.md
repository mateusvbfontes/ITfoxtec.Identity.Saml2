> ## Do you prefer to use OpenID Connect?
>You can use the [open-source](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/FoxIDs) and free [FoxIDs](https://www.foxids.com) Identity Services to translate from [SAML 2.0](https://www.foxids.com/docs/up-party-saml-2.0) to [OpenID Connect](https://www.foxids.com/docs/down-party-oidc). Then FoxIDs handles the SAML 2.0 traffic to the Identity Provider (IdP) and your application connects to FoxIDs with OpenID Connect ([FoxIDs samples](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/FoxIDs.Samples)).  
> *SAML 2.0 is an old standard with its shortcomings, and therefore it is often a better choice to use OpenID Connect in the application.*  
>You can likewise use FoxIDs to translate from the Danish [NemLog-in3 (MitID)](https://www.foxids.com/docs/up-party-howto-saml-2.0-nemlogin) and [Context Handler](https://www.foxids.com/docs/howto-saml-2.0-context-handler) to OpenID Connect.

The ITfoxtec Identity Saml2 package supports signing/encryption certificates in Azure Key Vault. 
Please see the [TestWebAppCoreAzureKeyVault](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/tree/master/test/TestWebAppCoreAzureKeyVault) sample. 

The ITfoxtec Identity Saml2 package is tested for compliance with AD FS, Azure AD, Azure AD B2C, the Danish NemLog-in3 (MitID), the Danish Context Handler and many other IdPs and RPs.

Please see the [test samples](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/tree/master/test).
The [TestWebAppCoreNemLogin3Sp](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/tree/master/test/TestWebAppCoreNemLogin3Sp) sample show how to implement an NemLog-in3 Service Provider (SP).

> You can use the [SAML 2.0 tool](https://www.foxids.com/tools/Saml) to decode tokens and create self-signed certificates with the [certificate tool](https://www.foxids.com/tools/Certificate).
